title: Embench Article in EETimes
---

Rick Merrit from EETimes has posted an article detailing the Embench
call for support.

Embench aims to create a new benchmark suite aimed at evaluating
micro-controller processors.  It was founded by a small group led by
Dave Patterson six months ago.  Embench is based around a set of core
ideas:

- Benchmark suites must be available free of cost and available under
  an open-source license.

- Benchmark suites must consist of a range of real programs, while
  providing a single summary number.

- Benchmark suites must be regularly updated to stay relevant in a
  fast-changing world.
